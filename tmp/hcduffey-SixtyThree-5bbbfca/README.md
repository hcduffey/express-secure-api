# SixtyThree
## Project Description
U.S. National Park tracker application that allows users to track which of the 63 National Parks they've been to, earn milestone badges associated with the parks, and make posts and reviews based on their experiences.
### MVP Goals
* As a user, I want to be able to login and see my parks visited/badges and associated reviews on my profile page
* As a user, I want to be able to collect milestone badges and review parks that I have been to
* As a user, I want to be able to see all of the parks on one page, linked with their associated show pages that display park info and reviews
* As a user, I want to be able to view other user profiles
### Stretch Goals
* As a user, I want to be able to see an interactive map of all the parks with pins that lead to each individual park
* As a user, I want to be able to interact with and search for other users
* As a user, I want to be able to have a customizable profile picture
* As a user, I want to be able to see my favorite park and reflections/highlights on my profile page
